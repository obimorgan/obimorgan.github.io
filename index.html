                    I am 33 years of age. Cheffing is my trade as mentioned in my <a href="robyMorganResume2021.pdf">CV</a>. I have been cooking throughout most of my 20’s. I began learning to cook after I graduated from highschool when I got kicked out of my parent’s house and desperately needed to earn some income. I  was lucky to be employed as a dishwasher at a friend’s family owned restaurant where I developed the love and passion for cooking. I enjoyed the 10 to 12  hour long shifts , the 3 to 4 hours of heavy stress during service, the sleep deprivations, the adrenaline kicks, and the sense of comradery we have among us “hospo” people.                </p>
                <p>
                    Cheffing is very rewarding but tiring at times, I am ready to move on to a new line of work.

                    I stumbled upon programming during the first corona lock down in Oslo, Norway 2020. A friend of mine suggested that I should look into programming because I like solving problems. Little did I know learning how to code is a problem to be solved in itself. But I am enjoying it very much, I am excited and curious as to where this new found interest of mine can take me.
